This project draws inspiration from spelltable.com, but instead of detecting Magic: The Gathering cards, it will instead Weiss Schwarz cards and display relevant information on the screen.

There is an active to-do list that shows the process and ongoing tasks to be finished, and references used will be updated frequently.
