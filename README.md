# Soul Searcher
This project draws inspiration from [spelltable.com](http://spelltable.com), but instead of detecting Magic: The Gathering cards, it will instead use Weiss Schwarz cards and display relevant information on the screen.

There is an active to-do list that shows the process and ongoing tasks to be finished, and references used will be updated frequently.

# Main Features 
## Search cards using websites
* Search English or Japanese edition cards by ID or with queries using the Weiss Schwarz [EN website](https://en.ws-tcg.com) or [JP website](https://ws-tcg.com/)
* Implementing search features to be able to used by a Discord bot (WIP)

## Card Identifier
Using a custom Haar Classifier, the program will automatically detect Weiss Schwarz cards and use the above search functions to display useful information about the card (WIP).

## Deck Builder and Tester
Users can create their own decks and test them out in a testing environment (WIP)

Stay tuned for more updates!
